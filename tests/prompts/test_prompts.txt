BASIC
1. Run a Stress test with base scenario for current quarter.
2. Get the status of my latest run.
3. Kill my current batch job.

SEQUENTIAL
4. Start a Stress run with scenario 'Severe' for cob date 20240331, 
    then monitor its progress until completion, and once it's done, 
    get the stress results for the same scenario and date.
5. I need to run both CCAR and RiskApetite jobs for March 2024 quarter-end. 
    Can you start both with the base scenario, wait for them to complete, and 
    then summarize the logs from both runs?
6. Start a Stress run with the 'Adverse' scenario. 
    If it completes within 30 seconds, get the stress results. 
    If it's still running after 30 seconds, terminate the run and 
    start a RiskApetite run instead.

ERROR HANDLING
7. Start a batch run with type 'StressTesting' for today. 
    If that doesn't work, try with the correct run type and let me know what happened.
8. Try to get allowance results for runtype 'special', cob '20240401', and scenario 'extreme'. 
    If you get an error, start a new run with the appropriate parameters first, 
    then try getting the results again.
9. Get the stress results for yesterday's run.

MONITORING
10. Start a CCAR run and give me regular updates on its progress every 20% completion. 
    Once it's done, show me the final log.
11. Show me all of my currently running batch jobs. 
    If there are any that have been running for more than 1 minute, terminate them and provide their logs.

CHAIN OF DEPENDENCIES
12. I need a complete analysis pipeline: 
    First, start a RiskApetite run with the base scenario. 
    After it completes, use its run ID to check the logs for any warnings. 
    Then start a Stress run with the same parameters. 
    Finally, once the Stress run completes, get both allowance and stress results for comparison.
